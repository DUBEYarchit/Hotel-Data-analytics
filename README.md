**Overview**
This project focuses on Hotel Data Analytics using the Pandas library, as part of the Python certification program from Codebasics. The goal is to perform various data analysis tasks on hotel-related datasets to gain insights and make informed decisions.

**Datasets**
The project utilizes the following datasets:
fact_bookings.csv, dim_date.csv, dim_hotels.csv, dim_rooms.csv, fact_aggregated_bookings.csv

**Key Tasks**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the structure and characteristics of the datasets. This involved examining key statistical measures, identifying patterns, and exploring relationships within the data.

**Data Cleaning**
Data cleaning was performed to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the datasets. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of the analysis.

**Data Transformation**
Data transformation steps were implemented to reshape and restructure the data, making it suitable for the intended analysis. This includes aggregations, merging datasets, and creating new variables if necessary.

**Insight Generation**
The primary objective of the project was to generate meaningful insights from the data. This involves extracting valuable information, trends, and patterns that can aid in decision-making processes related to hotel operations.
